### Hi there! I am Queite ðŸ‘‹
A web developer student at Trybe.

Courage to face the unknown and the love for learning led me to development.

I found in tech the perfect opportunity to practice developed skills and knowledge, such as time management and organization, analytical thinking, collaboration, open-mindedness, and adaptability while learning and improving so many others.

The technologies I have worked with are: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Jest, React, RTL.

There is always more to learn, always a new world opening up. All that knowledge and possibilities really bring excitement since excel for me is doing better than I did before.

The collaboration culture I have found is exactly what I was looking for. People working together to improve other people's lives, to add to each other.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
